Turtl for Firefox (deprecated)
==============================

This houses the source code for the old Turtl Firefox extension.

It has been replaced by the Firefox [bookmarking extension](https://github.com/turtl/firefox-bookmarker).
Instead of running Turtl in the browser, the new extension just sends
bookmarking data directly to the Turtl desktop app.
