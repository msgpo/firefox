		<h1>About Turtl</h1>
		<p>
			Turtl is an open-source note and bookmark (and soon file) storage
			app. Not only does it aim to be fast and useful, it encrypts all
			your data using your login/password before storing anything on the
			Turtl servers.
		</p>
		<p>
			This means that nobody in the world, except you and those who you
			specifically share with, is able to see the contents of your data
			(not even the NSA, or any other government agency).
		</p>

			<a href="http://turtl.it" target="_blank">the Turtl website</a> or
			<a href="https://github.com/turtl" target="_blank">browse the source</a>.
