		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			Tagit is an open-source application for note and bookmark storage.
			Not only does it aim to be incredibly fast and useful, it encrypts
			all your data using your login/password before storing anything on
			the Tagit servers.
		</p>
		<p>
			This means that nobody in the world, except you and those who you
			specifically share with, are able to see the contents of your data
			(not even the NSA, or any other government agency).
		</p>
